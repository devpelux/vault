# Vault

Portable password manager open source and completely offline forever.


## Single file executable

The main application is a single `.exe` file, it does not require installation, and does not save anything on your pc.
It creates a database file (`vault.db`), and saves all the passwords on this file.
It creates also a `config.json` file that will contain all the application settings.

You can move the executable file and the database file into a pendrive and take all the passwords with you, the `config.json` file is not required but you can also copy that file to take keep the settings.
